## **1. Project Title**  
**Loan Risk Analysis and Performance Insights**  
This project explores the  loan data to uncover risk patterns, understand borrower behavior, and provide actionable recommendations to improve loan performance and financial decision-making.



## **2. Executive Summary**  
### **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to analyze loan performance data, identify patterns that contribute to loan risks, and provide insights to help financial institutions make smarter decisions while minimizing defaults.  

### **Context**  
To demonstrate versatility as a data analyst, I used a range of tools:  
- **MySQL**: To extract and query the data.  
- **Excel**: For cleaning, exploring, and building initial dashboards.  
- **Power BI & Tableau**: To create professional, interactive dashboards for better storytelling and data presentation.  



## **3. Business Problem**  
### **Problem Identification**  
Managing loan risk is a critical challenge for financial institutions. The analysis focused on:  
- Categorizing loans as “good” or “bad” based on repayment performance.  
- Understanding which borrower characteristics and loan attributes increase default risk.  

### **Business Impact**  
By addressing these challenges, financial institutions can:  
- Reduce the likelihood of loan defaults.  
- Offer better-targeted loan products.  
- Improve their risk assessment and decision-making processes.  



## **4. Methodology**  
### **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
- Loan data was first queried and analysed using **MySQL**.  
- I used **Excel** to clean the dataset, remove redundancies, and calculate new fields.  
- The dataset was further segmented to uncover patterns and trends.  

### **Analysis Techniques**  
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in Excel to spot trends.  
- Built summary statistics, pivot tables, and charts to simplify complex relationships.  
- Created interactive dashboards in **Power BI** and **Tableau** to showcase insights like:  
  - Loan performance by region and grade.  
  - Trends in loan applications, funding, and repayment.  



## **5. Skills Highlighted**  
### **Tools and Technologies**  
- **MySQL**: To handle and query the data.  
- **Excel**: For analysis and initial dashboards.  
- **Power BI & Tableau**: To bring insights to life with dynamic visualizations.  

This project reflects my ability to work across all essential tools for a data analyst, showcasing skills in querying, cleaning, analysis, and storytelling with data.



## **6. Results & Recommendations**  
### **Findings**  
- **Good loans account for 86.2%**, while **13.8% are bad loans**, highlighting areas of risk.  
- Loans with a **higher Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio** are more likely to default.  
- Borrowers with mortgages tend to repay better than renters.  
- **60-month loans** have a higher risk compared to 36-month loans.  

### **Key Insights**  
- **Debt consolidation** is the most common loan purpose, showing a strong need for financial restructuring solutions.  
- Some borrower segments, such as those in specific regions or with certain loan grades, carry higher risks, which could inform future lending strategies.  

### **Dashboards**  
Using Power BI and Tableau, I created dashboards to:  
- Summarize loan performance metrics.  
- Visualize trends in borrower behavior and loan terms.  
- Provide a clear geographical view of loan data.  



## **7. Next Steps**  
### **Future Improvements**  
- Building ***predictive models*** to estimate default risks more accurately.  
- Exploring deep into borrower demographics to create ***targeted marketing strategies***.  
- Automate dashboard updates with live data integration in Power BI or Tableau for ***real-time insights***.
