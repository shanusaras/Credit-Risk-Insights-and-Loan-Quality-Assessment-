# **Loan Risk Analysis and Performance Insights**

## **1. Project Title**  
**Loan Risk Analysis and Performance Insights**  
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of loan data to identify risk patterns, understand borrower behavior, and recommend data-driven solutions to improve financial decision-making.



## **2. Executive Summary**  
### **Objective**  
To analyze loan performance data and identify insights related to loan issuance, funding, and repayment. The project aims to help financial institutions make informed decisions, reduce risk, and optimize loan performance.  

### **Context**  
This project leverages a range of tools and platforms commonly required in data analyst roles:  
- **MySQL**: For querying and managing the dataset.  
- **Excel**: For data cleaning, analysis, and dashboarding.  
- **Power BI & Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to communicate insights effectively.  



## **3. Business Problem**  
### **Problem Identification**  
Financial institutions often face challenges in managing loan risk due to diverse borrower profiles, repayment behaviors, and market fluctuations. The key objectives of this analysis were:  
- To classify loans into good and bad categories based on repayment performance.  
- To identify factors influencing loan risk (e.g., debt-to-income ratio, loan purpose).  

### **Business Impact**  
Understanding these patterns helps banks:  
- Reduce the risk of defaults.  
- Optimize loan pricing strategies.  
- Improve customer segmentation and targeting.  



## **4. Methodology**  
### **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
- Data was extracted and queried using **MySQL**.  
- Irrelevant and redundant data were removed in **Excel**, and missing values were addressed.  
- Created calculated fields like Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio and segmented data for deeper analysis.  

### **Analysis Techniques**  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Excel to identify trends and outliers.  
- Created summary statistics and pivot tables for in-depth insights.  
- Developed interactive dashboards in **Power BI** and **Tableau** to visualize:  
  - Loan performance by region, grade, and purpose.  
  - Trends in loan applications and funding over time.  



## **5. Skills**  
### **Tools, Languages, & Software**  
- **Querying**: MySQL  
- **Analysis & Dashboarding**: Excel  
- **Visualization**: Power BI and Tableau  

This project demonstrates proficiency across all tools commonly expected in data analyst roles, showcasing a well-rounded skill set for data querying, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  



## **6. Results & Business Recommendation**  
### **Business Impact**  
The analysis led to key insights that can drive actionable business decisions:  
- **86.2% of loans** were classified as "good loans," reflecting strong repayment performance.  
- Bad loans (13.8%) highlighted areas requiring attention, such as higher default rates for certain grades or regions.  
- Debt consolidation emerged as the top loan purpose, accounting for the majority of applications, suggesting high demand for financial restructuring loans.  

### **Insights**  
- Higher debt-to-income (DTI) ratios correlated with increased default risk.  
- Borrowers with mortgages had better repayment behavior compared to renters.  
- 60-month loans carried higher risk compared to 36-month loans.  

### **Visualizations**  
Interactive dashboards in Power BI and Tableau provided:  
- A summary view of loan performance metrics (e.g., funding, repayment, interest rates).  
- Geographical breakdown of loan applications.  
- Trends in loan term preferences and borrower profiles.  



## **7. Next Steps**  
### **Future Work**  
- Implement predictive models to forecast loan default risk.  
- Conduct a deeper analysis of borrower demographics for targeted marketing strategies.  
- Automate the dashboard updates using live data integration with Power BI/Tableau.
